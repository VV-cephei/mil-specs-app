      "description": "The barometric-pressure test is performed under conditions simulating the low atmospheric pressure encountered in the nonpressurized portions of aircraft and other vehicles in high-altitude flight. This test is intended primarily to determine the ability of component parts and materials to avoid voltage breakdown failures due to the reduced dielectric strength of air and other insulating materials at reduced pressures. Even when low pressures do not produce complete electrical breakdown, corona and its undesirable effects, including losses and ionization are intensified. The simulated high-altitude conditions of this test can also be employed to investigate the influence on components' operating characteristics, of other effects of reduced pressure, including changes in dielectric constants of materials, and decreased ability of thinner air to transfer heat away from heat-producing components.",

The immersion of the part under evaluation into liquid at widely different temperatures subjects it to thermal and mechanical stresses which will readily detect a defective terminal assembly, or a partially closed seam or molded enclosure. Defects of these types can result from faulty construction or from mechanical damage such as might be produced during physical or environmental tests. The immersion test is generally performed immediately following such tests because it will tend to aggravate any incipient defects in seals, seams, and bushings which might otherwise escape notice. This test provides a simple and ready means of detection of the migration of liquids. Effects noted can include lowered insulation resistance, corrosion of internal parts, and appearance of salt crystals. The test described is not intended as a thermal- shock or corrosion test, although it may incidentally reveal inadequacies in these respects. This is a destructive test and shall not be used as a 100 percent test or screen.",

The immersion test is generally performed immediately following such tests because it will tend to aggravate any incipient defects in seals, seams, and bushings which might otherwise escape notice. This test is essentially a laboratory test condition, and the procedure is intended only as a measurement of the effectiveness of the seal following this test. The choice of fresh or salt water as a test liquid is dependent on the nature of the component part under test. When electrical measurements are made after immersion cycling to obtain evidence of leakage through seals, the use of a salt solution instead of fresh water will facilitate detection of moisture penetration.

      "category": "Environmental tests",
      "conditions": [],
      "description": "This test is to measure the resistance offered by the insulating members of a component part to an impressed direct voltage tending to produce a leakage of current through or on the surface of these members. Insulation- resistance measurements should not be considered the equivalent of dielectric withstanding voltage or electric breakdown tests. A clean, dry insulation may have a high insulation resistance, and yet possess a mechanical fault that would cause failure in the dielectric withstanding voltage test. Since insulating members composed of different materials or combinations of materials may have inherently different insulation resistances, the numerical value of measured insulation resistance cannot properly be taken as a direct measure of the degree of cleanliness or absence of deterioration.",
      "purpose": "This test is to measure the resistance offered by the insulating members of a component part to an impressed direct voltage tending to produce a leakage of current through or on the surface of these members. Insulation- resistance measurements should not be considered the equivalent of dielectric withstanding voltage or electric breakdown tests. A clean, dry insulation may have a high insulation resistance, and yet possess a mechanical fault that would cause failure in the dielectric withstanding voltage test. Since insulating members composed of different materials or combinations of materials may have inherently different insulation resistances, the numerical value of measured insulation resistance cannot properly be taken as a direct measure of the degree of cleanliness or absence of deterioration. 1.1 Factors affecting use. Factors affecting insulation-resistance measurements include temperature, humidity, residual charges, charging currents or time constant of instrument and measured circuit, test voltage, previous conditioning, and duration of uninterrupted test voltage application (electrification time). In connection with this last-named factor, it is characteristic of certain components (for example, capacitors and cables) for the current to usually fall from an instantaneous high value to a steady lower value at a rate of decay which depends on such factors as test voltage, temperature, insulating materials, capacitance, and external circuit resistance. Consequently, the measured insulation resistance will increase for an appreciable time as test voltage is applied uninterruptedly. Because of this phenomenon, it may take many minutes to approach maximum insulation-resistance readings, but specifications usually require that readings be made after a specified time. This shortens the testing time considerably while still permitting significant test results, provided the insulation resistance is reasonably close to steady-state value, the current versus time curve is known, or suitable correction factors are applied to these measurements. For certain components, a steady instrument reading may be obtained in a matter of seconds. When insulation-resistance measurements are made before and after a test, both measurements should be made under the same conditions.",
      "apparatus": "Insulation-resistance measurements shall be made on an apparatus suitable for the characteristics of the component to be measured such as a megohm bridge, megohmmeter, insulation-resistance test set, or other suitable apparatus.",
      "procedure": "When special preparations or conditions such as special test fixtures, reconnections, grounding, isolation, low atmospheric pressure, humidity, or immersion in water are required, they shall be specified. Insulation- resistance measurements shall be made between the mutually insulated points or between insulated points and ground, as specified. When electrification time is a factor, the insulation-resistance measurements shall be made immediately after the specified time (see 4) of uninterrupted test voltage application, unless otherwise specified. However, if the instrument-reading indicates that an insulation resistance meets the specified limit, and is steady or increasing, the test may be terminated before the end of the specified period. When more than one measurement is specified, subsequent measurements of insulation resistance shall be made using the same polarity as the initial measurements. Unless otherwise specified, the direct potential applied to the specimen shall be that indicated by one of the test condition letters, as specified below, and insulation resistance measurements shall be made with both polarities of the applied voltage: Test condition Test potential A 10 volts ±10% B 25 volts ±10% C 50 volts ±10% D 100 volts ±10% E 500 volts ±10% F 1,000 volts ±10% For inplant quality conformance testing, any voltage may be used provided it is equal to or greater than the minimum potential allowed by the applicable test condition. Unless otherwise specified, the measurement error at the insulation-resistance value shall not exceed 10 percent. Proper guarding techniques shall be used to prevent erroneous readings due to leakage along undesired paths.",

      "title": "Moisture Resistance",
      "category": "Environmental tests",
      "conditions": [],
      "description": "The moisture resistance test is performed for the purpose of evaluating, in an accelerated manner, the resistance of component parts and constituent materials to the deteriorative effects of the high-humidity and heat conditions typical of tropical environments. Most tropical degradation results directly or indirectly from absorption of moisture vapor and films by vulnerable insulating materials, and from surface wetting of metals and insulation. These phenomena produce many types of deterioration, including corrosion of metals; constituents of materials; and detrimental changes in electrical properties. This test differs from the steady-state humidity test and derives its added effectiveness in its employment of temperature cycling, which provides alternate periods of condensation and drying essential to the development of the corrosion processes and, in addition, produces a \"breathing\" action of moisture into partially sealed containers. Increased effectiveness is also obtained by use of a higher temperature, which intensifies the effects of humidity. The test includes a low-temperature subcycle that acts as an accelerant to reveal otherwise indiscernible evidences of deterioration since stresses caused by freezing moisture tend to widen cracks and fissures. As a result, the deterioration can be detected by the measurement of electrical characteristics (including such tests as voltage breakdown and insulation resistance) or by performance of a test for sealing. Provision is made for the application of a polarizing voltage across insulation to investigate the possibility of electrolysis, which can promote eventual dielectric breakdown. This test also provides for electrical loading of certain components, if desired, in order to determine the resistance of current-carrying components, especially fine wires and contacts, to electrochemical corrosion. Results obtained with this test are reproducible and have been confirmed by investigations of field failures. This test has proved reliable for indicating those parts which are unsuited for tropical field use.",

This test is destructive. The presence of leak test fluorocarbon vapor in the IGA is an indication of failure to meet leak test requirements of Test Method 1014 of this test method standard. 1.1 Definitions. The definitions for all terms used herein shall be as specified herein. a) Accuracy: A combination of the bias and precision of an analytical procedure, which reflects the closeness of a measured value to the true value. For the purposes of laboratory suitability, accuracy means the closeness of a measured value to its reference standard. b) Adjusted volume: The volume equivalent to a device having one atmosphere of gas. (Physical internal volume times the number of atmospheres in the device divided by one atmosphere.) c) Air burst: A sample of room air used to determine the sensitivity (calibration factor) for oxygen, nitrogen and argon using room air as a calibration source. An air burst reading shall be taken weekly (every week testing is performed). The results of all air burst measurements shall be recorded, retained and made available to the qualifying activity upon request. d) Atomic mass unit (AMU): Has the same meaning as \"mass-to-change-ratio\". The term \"mass\" is sometimes used to represent AMU or mass-to-charge ratio. (Example: Mass range has the same meaning as \"AMU range\", which has the same meaning as \"mass-to-charge-ratio range\".) e) Continuous scanning: Continuous scanning mode refers to acquiring spectra data in fractions of an AMU so as to be able to display a peak shape. This procedure stores substantial amounts of data and may be limited in speed due to the requirement to save much more data. It also requires a method to mathematically process the peak shape data to establish the peak height or peak area and determine the fractional AMU value of the peak centroid. f) Device volume: All references to the device internal volume specified in this document shall be interpreted to mean the adjusted volume of the device. g) High mass resolution: Refers to mass spectrometers that can resolve peaks that are separated by tenths and even hundredths of 1 AMU. h) IGA Submission Application: All information supplied by the client to the Internal Gas Analysis (IGA) laboratory in the form of PO instructions, IGA laboratory submission form, or other document(s) specifying some or all of the following: military standard test method, package internal volume, lid thickness, puncture location, internal clearance measurement, number of samples to be tested, package internal pressure, failure criteria, and other related test instructions. i) Ionization source: The hardware and the process to ionize the gases and focusing the ions into the mass spectrometer. Maintaining the ionization source in a clean condition is critical to good quantitative results. j) Mass peak (or Peak): The rise and fall of the ion signal intensity over a finite mass range. The peak must be processed to determine the amplitude of the peak and the AMU value of the peak centroid in order to perform qualitative or quantitative analysis.",
      "apparatus": "The mass spectrometer used to perform the internal gas analysis test shall meet the following requirements: a. Mass range. The mass spectrometer shall be capable of a minimum mass range of 1 to 140 AMU. b. Detection limit: (1) The mass spectrometer shall be capable of reproducibly detecting the specified moisture content for a given volume package with signal to noise ratio of 20 to 1 or greater. (i.e., for a specified limit of 5,000 parts per million volume (ppmv)). (2) For all gases that are specified in the failure criteria, other than moisture, the mass spectrometer system shall be capable of detecting that gas at the specified limit with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 20 to 1. (3) The mass spectrometer shall also be capable of detecting a 250 ppmv minimum detection limit to moisture. (4) The mass spectrometer shall be capable of a 50 ppmv minimum detection limit to nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, helium and fluorocarbons. Fluorocarbons shall be identified by the presences of masses 69 and 119. c. A vacuum opening chamber which can contain the device and a vacuum transfer passage connecting the device to the mass spectrometer. A vacuum transfer passage shall efficiently (without significant loss of moisture from adsorption) transfer the gas from the device to the mass spectrometer ion source for measurement. d. For initial certification of systems or extension of suitability, device temperature on systems using an external fixture shall be characterized by placing a thermocouple into the cavity of a blank device of similar mass, internal volume, construction, and size. This shall be a means for proving the device temperature that has been maintained at 100°C ±5°C for the minimum 10 minutes. This also applies to devices prebaked in an external oven but tested with the external fixture to adjust for any temperature drop during the transfer. These records shall be maintained by the test laboratory. e. A piercing arrangement functioning within the opening chamber or transfer passage, which can pierce the specimen housing (without breaking the mass spectrometer chamber vacuum and without disturbing the package sealing medium), thus allowing the specimen's internal gases to escape into the chamber and mass spectrometer. NOTE: A sharp-pointed piercing tool, actuated from outside the chamber wall via a bellows to permit movement shall be used to pierce both metal and ceramic packages. For ceramic packages, or devices with thick metal lids, the package lid or cover should be locally thinned by abrasion to facilitate localized piercing. f. A pressure sensing device to measure the pressure rise in the transfer passage during the test. This pressure sensor is used to read a relative pressure change when the device is punctured. This relative pressure change indicates the relative quantity of gas in the device when comparing the test results of one device to another device. The pressure reading is not intended to be absolute. Although the pressure gauge reading is reported, the pressure gauge is for indication only.",
      "procedure": "All devices shall be prebaked for 16 to 24 hours at 100°C ±5°C prior to test. Ovens shall have a means to indicate if a power interruption occurs during the prebaking period and for how long the temperature drops below 100°C ±5°C. Devices whose temperature drops below 100°C ±5°C for more than 1 hour shall undergo another prebake to begin a minimum of 12 hours later. A maximum 5-minute transfer time from prebake to hot insertion into apparatus shall be allowed. If 5 minutes is exceeded, device shall be returned to the prebake oven and prebake continued until device reaches 100°C ±5°C. The system shall be maintained at a stable temperature equal to or above the device temperature. The fixturing in the vacuum opening chamber shall position the specimen as required by the piercing arrangement of 2.e, and maintain the device at 100°C ±5°C for a minimum of 10 minutes prior to piercing. After device insertion, the device and chamber shall be pumped down and baked out at a temperature of 100°C ±5°C until the background pressure level will not prevent achieving the specified measurement accuracy and sensitivity. The background vacuum spectra shall be acquired and shall later be subtracted from the sample spectra. After pump down, the device case or lid shall be punctured and the following properties of the released gases shall be measured, using the mass spectrometer: a. The water-vapor content of the released gases, as a percent by unit volume or ppmv of the total gas content. b. The proportions (by volume) of the other following gases: N2, He, Mass 69 (fluorocarbons), O2, Ar, H2, CO2, CH4, NH3, and other solvents, if available. Calculations shall be made and reported on all gases present. Data reduction shall be performed in a manner which will preclude the cracking pattern interference from other gas specie(s) in the calculations of moisture content. Data shall be corrected for any system dependent matrix effects such as the presence of hydrogen in the internal ambient. c. The increase in chamber pressure as the gases are released by piercing the device package. A pressure change of ±25 percent from expected for that package volume and pressurization may indicate that (1) the puncture was not fully accomplished, (2) the device package was not sealed hermetically, or (3) does not contain the normal internal pressure. d. The test laboratory should provide comments describing the spectra of unknowns or gases that are present but not in sufficient concentration to be identified or quantified with reasonable certainty. e. If the test laboratory has reason to believe that the test results may be invalid due to reasons such as improper puncture of the device or equipment malfunction, the results shall be reported as “no test” with additional comments provided. The device may be replaced with another. NOTE: The device shall be hermetic in accordance with test method 1014 of this standard, and free from any surface contaminants which may interfere with accurate water vapor content measurement. The internal gas analysis laboratory (IGA) is not required to test for hermeticity in accordance with test method 1014 of this standard. It is recommended that samples submitted for testing shall include information about the manufacturing process, including sealing pressure, sealing gas, free internal cavity volume, lid thickness at puncture site, lid material, and the location of the puncture site."

This procedure addresses only steady state irradiations, and is not applicable to pulse type irradiations. These tests may produce severe degradation of the electrical properties of irradiated devices and thus should be considered destructive tests. 1.1 Definitions. Definitions of terms used in this procedure are given below: a. Ionizing radiation effects. The changes in the electrical parameters of a device or integrated circuit resulting from radiation-induced charge. These are also referred to as total dose effects. b. In-flux test. Electrical measurements made on devices during irradiation exposure. c. Internal dose-pattern. This is in reference to the state vector which specifies the logic condition of all elements within a logic circuit during radiation exposure. d. Not in-flux test. Electrical measurements made on devices at any time other than during irradiation. e. Remote tests. Electrical measurements made on devices which are physically removed from the radiation location. f. Time dependent effects. Significant degradation in electrical parameters caused by the growth or annealing or both of radiation-induced trapped charge after irradiation. Similar effects also take place during irradiation. g. Accelerated annealing test. A procedure utilizing elevated temperature to accelerate time-dependent effects. h. Enhanced Low Dose Rate Sensitivity (ELDRS). Used to refer to a part that shows enhanced radiation induced damage at dose rates below 50 rad(Si)/s. i. Overtest. A factor that is applied to the specification dose to determine the test dose level that the samples must pass to be acceptable at the specification level. An ovetest factor of 1.5 means that the parts must be tested at 1.5 times the specification dose. j Parameter Delta Design Margin (PDDM). A design margin that is applied to the radiation induced change in an electrical parameter. For a PDDM of 2 the change in a parameter at a specified dose from the pre- irradiation value is multiplied by two and added to the pre-irradiation value to see if the sample exceeds the post-irradiation parameter limit. For example, if the pre-irradiation value of Ib is 30 nA and the post-irradiation value at 20 krad(Si) is 70 nA (change in Ib is 40 nA), then for a PDDM of 2 the post-irradiation value would be 110 nA (30 nA + 2 X 40 nA). If the allowable post-irradiation limit is 100 nA the part would fail.",
      "apparatus": "The apparatus shall consist of the radiation source, electrical test instrumentation, test circuit board(s), cabling, interconnect board or switching system, an appropriate dosimetry measurement system, and an environmental chamber (if required for time-dependent effects measurements or elevated/cryogenic temperature irradiation). Adequate precautions shall be observed to obtain an electrical measurement system with sufficient insulation, ample shielding, satisfactory grounding, and suitable low noise characteristics. 2.1 Radiation source. The radiation source used in the test shall be the uniform field of a 60Co gamma ray source. Uniformity of the radiation field in the volume where devices are irradiated shall be within ±10 percent as measured by the dosimetry system, unless otherwise specified. The intensity of the gamma ray field of the 60Co source shall be known with an uncertainty of no more than ±5 percent. Field uniformity and intensity can be affected by changes in the location of the device with respect to the radiation source and the presence of radiation absorption and scattering materials.",
      "procedure": "The test devices shall be irradiated and subjected to accelerated annealing testing (if required for time-dependent effects testing) as specified by a test plan. This plan shall specify the device description, irradiation conditions, device bias conditions, dosimetry system, operating conditions, measurement parameters and conditions, and accelerated annealing test conditions (if required). 3.1 Sample selection and handling. Only devices which have passed the electrical specifications as defined in the test plan shall be submitted to radiation testing. Unless otherwise specified, the test samples shall be randomly selected from the parent population and identically packaged. Each part shall be individually identifiable to enable pre- and post- irradiation comparison. For device types which are ESD-sensitive, proper handling techniques shall be used to prevent damage to the devices. 3.2 Burn-in. For some devices, there are differences in the total dose radiation response before and after burn-in. Unless it has been shown by prior characterization or by design that burn-in has negligible effect (parameters remain within postirradiation specified electrical limits) on the total dose radiation response, then one of the following must be done: 3.2.1 The manufacturer shall subject the radiation samples to the specified burn-in conditions prior to conducting total dose radiation testing or 3.2.2 The manufacturer shall develop a correction factor, (which is acceptable to the parties to the test) taking into account the changes in total dose response resulting from subjecting product to burn-in. The correction factor shall then be used to accept product for total dose response without subjecting the test samples to burn-in. 3.3 Dosimetry measurements. The radiation field intensity at the location of the device under test shall be determined prior to testing by dosimetry or by source decay correction calculations, as appropriate, to assure conformance to test level and uniformity requirements. The dose to the device under test shall be determined one of two ways: (1) by measurement during the irradiation with an appropriate dosimeter, or (2) by correcting a previous dosimetry value for the decay of the 60Co source intensity in the intervening time. Appropriate correction shall be made to convert from the measured or calculated dose in the dosimeter material to the dose in the device under test.",

      "purpose": "This test procedure defines the detailed requirements for performing latchup testing of microcircuits to identify susceptibility to dose rate induced latchup. 1.1 Definitions. Definitions of terms used in this procedure are provided below: a. Dose rate induced latchup. Dose rate induced latchup is regenerative device action in which a parasitic region (e.g., a four layer p-n-p-n or n-p-n-p path) is turned on by a photocurrent generated by a pulse of ionizing radiation, and remains on for an indefinite period of time after the photocurrent subsides. The device will remain latched as long as the power supply delivers voltage greater than the holding voltage and current greater than the holding current. Latchup disrupts normal circuit operation in some portion of the circuit, and may also cause catastrophic failure due to local heating of semiconductor regions, metallization or bond wires. b. Latchup windows. A latchup window is the phenomenon in which a device exhibits latchup in a specific range of dose rates. Above and below this range, the device does not latchup. A device may exhibit more than one latchup window. This phenomenon has been observed for some CMOS logic devices, oxide sidewall logic and LSI memories, and may occur in other devices. c. Combinational logic. Combinational (determined) logic devices are those whose output is solely determined by the logic signals at its inputs (except for switching delays). Combinational logic circuits contain no internal storage elements, and include multiplexers, decoders, and gates. d. Sequential logic. Sequential (nondetermined) devices are those in which the output state at any given time depends on the sequence and time relationship of logic signals that were previously applied to its inputs. Sequential logic circuits contain internal storage elements. Examples of sequential logic devices are shift registers, memories, counters, and flip-flops. e. Recovery period. The recovery period is the time interval in which the device supply current recovers from the radiation pulse. f.

Either of two radiation sources shall be used for latchup testing: 1) a flash x-ray machine (FXR), or 2) an electron linear accelerator (LINAC). The FXR shall be used in the x-ray mode and the LINAC in the electron (e-beam) mode. The FXR peak (endpoint) energy shall be 2 MeV or greater, and the LINAC beam energy shall be 10 MeV or greater.

A calibrated PIN diode may be used to obtain both the shape of the radiation pulse and the dose, and the following DOD adopted American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards or their equivalent may be used: ASTM E 666 - Standard Method for Calculation of Absorbed Dose from Gamma or X Radiation. ASTM E 668 - Standard Practice for the Application of Thermoluminescence Dosimetry (TLD) Systems for Determining Absorbed Dose in Radiation Hardness Testing of Electronic Devices. ASTM E 1249 - Minimizing Dosimetry Errors in Radiation Hardness Testing of Silicon Electronic Devices.",
      "procedure": "3.1 Device identification. In all cases, devices shall be serialized, and the applicable recorded test data shall be traceable to the individual device. 3.2 Radiation safety. All personnel shall adhere to the health and safety requirements established by the local radiation safety officer or health physicist. 3.3 Total dose limit. Unless otherwise specified, any device exposed to more than 10 percent of its total dose limit shall be considered to have been destructively tested. The total dose limit shall be determined for each device type to be tested, and shall be specified in the test plan. 3.4 Characterization testing and analysis. Characterization tests should be performed on new or unfamiliar device types to determine their performance as a function of dose rate and to establish requirements for production testing. Because latchup is dependent on lot to lot variations, samples for characterization tests should be pulled from the production lot(s). The following are examples of information gained from characterization testing: a. Latchup threshold as a function of radiation dose, dose rate, and pulse width. b. Existence and dose rate range of latchup windows. To check for windows, latchup testing is performed over a wide range of dose rates in fine increments. c. Worst case or unique conditions that cause the device to exhibit latchup, such as operating voltage, temperature, and bias conditions. d. Method(s) to detect latchup, e.g., monitoring supply current, functional testing, or both. Note that in-situ functional tests must be thorough enough to determine if a small portion of a large circuit has latched without drawing enough additional current to significantly increase the device supply current. e. Group A electrical parameter degradation subsequent to latchup testing. f. Holding current and holding voltage. Before testing LSI/VLSI circuits, an analysis is often required to determine likely latchup paths and requirements for bias conditions, exposure states, and functional testing. These large circuits often have too many outputs to be monitored individually, and through the analysis, monitored outputs can be limited to those most apt to show a change should latchup occur."

      "description": "This test procedure defines the requirements for testing the response of packaged digital integrated circuits to pulsed ionizing radiation. A flash x-ray or linear accelerator is used as a source of pulses of ionizing radiation. The response may include transient output signals, changes in the state of internal storage elements, and transient current surges at inputs, outputs, and power supply connections. The dose rate at which logic or change-of-state errors first occur is of particular interest in many applications.",
      "purpose": "This test procedure defines the requirements for testing the response of packaged digital integrated circuits to pulsed ionizing radiation. A flash x-ray or linear accelerator is used as a source of pulses of ionizing radiation. The response may include transient output signals, changes in the state of internal storage elements, and transient current surges at inputs, outputs, and power supply connections. The dose rate at which logic or change-of- state errors first occur is of particular interest in many applications. 1.1 Definitions. Definitions of terms used in this procedure are given below: a. Dose rate threshold for upset. The dose rate which causes either: (1) A transient output upset for which the change in output voltage of an operating digital integrated circuit goes either above or below (as appropriate) specified logic levels (see 3.2 on transient voltage criteria), and the circuit spontaneously recovers to its preirradiation condition after the radiation pulse subsides, or (2) A stored data or logic state upset for which there is a change in the state of one or more internal memory or logic elements that does not recover spontaneously after the radiation pulse. However, the circuit can be restored to its preirradiation condition by applying the same sequence of logic signals to its inputs that were previously used to establish the preirradiation condition, or (3) A dynamic upset which results in a change in the expected output or stored test pattern of a device that is functionally operating during the time it is irradiated. The upset response may depend on the precise time relationship between the radiation pulse and the operating cycle of the device. For operations requiring many clock signals, it may be necessary to use a wide radiation pulse. b. Dose rate. Energy absorbed per unit time per unit mass by a given material from the radiation field to which it is exposed. c. Combinational logic circuit. A digital logic circuit with the property that its output state is solely determined by the logic signals at its inputs. Combinational logic circuits contain no internal storage elements. Examples of combinational circuits include gates, multiplexers, and decoders. d. Sequential logic circuit. A digital logic circuit with the property that its output state at a given time depends on the sequence and time relationship of logic signals that were previously applied to its inputs. Sequential logic circuits contain internal storage elements. Examples of sequential logic circuits include memories, shift registers, counters, and flip-flops. e. State vector. A state vector completely specifies the logic condition of all elements within a logic circuit. For combinational circuits the state vector includes the logic signals that are applied to all inputs; for sequential circuits the state vector must also include the sequence and time relationship of all input signals (this may include many clock cycles).",
      "apparatus": "Before testing can be done, the state vectors must be selected for radiation testing. This requires a logic diagram of the test device. The apparatus used for testing shall consist of the radiation source, dosimetry equipment, a test circuit board, line drivers, cables, and electrical test instrumentation to measure the transient response, provide bias, and perform functional tests. Adequate precautions shall be observed to obtain an electrical measurement system with ample shielding, satisfactory grounding, and low noise from electrical interference or from the radiation environment. 2.1 Radiation source. The radiation source used in this test shall be either a flash x-ray machine (FXR) used in the photon mode or a linear accelerator (LINAC) used in the electron beam mode. The LINAC beam energy shall be greater than 10 MeV. The radiation source shall provide a uniform (within 20 percent) radiation level across the area where the device and the dosimeter will be placed. The radiation pulse width for narrow pulse measurements shall be between 10 and 50 ns. For narrow pulse measurements either a LINAC or FXR may be used. Wide pulse measurements (typically 1 - 10 µs) shall be performed with a LINAC. The pulse width for LINAC irradiations shall be specified. The dose rate at the location of the device under test shall be adjustable between 106 and 1012 rads(Si)/s (or as required) for narrow pulse measurements and between 105 and 1011 rads(Si)/s (or as required) for wide pulse measurements. Unless otherwise specified, a test device exposed to a total dose that exceeds 20 percent of the total dose failure level shall be considered as destructively tested and shall be removed from the lot (see 1.2a). 2.2 Dosimetry equipment. Dosimetry equipment must include a system for measuring total dose, such as a thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) or calorimeter, a pulse shape monitor, and an active dosimeter that allows the dose rate to be determined from electronic measurements, e.g., a p-i-n detector, Faraday cup, secondary emission monitor, or current transformer.",
      "procedure": "An outline of the procedure is as follows: a) determine the state vectors (or sequence of test vectors for a dynamic test) in which the device will be irradiated; b) following the test plan, set up the test fixture, functional test equipment, and transient measurement equipment; c) set up and calibrate the radiation source; d) perform a noise check on the instrumentation; and e) test devices at a sequence of radiation pulses, determining the transient response at specified dose rates. The dose rate upset level can be determined by measuring the transient response at several dose rates, using successive approximation to determine the radiation level for dose rate upset. 3.1 State vector selection. Two approaches can be used to select the state vectors in which a device is to be irradiated: a. Multiple output logic states. Partition the circuit into functional blocks. Determine the logic path for each output, and identify similar internal functions. For example, a 4-bit counter can be separated into control, internal flip-flop, and output logic cells. Four identical logic paths exist, corresponding to each of the four bits. Determine the total number of unique output logic state combinations, and test the circuit in each of these states. For the counter example this results in 16 combinations so that the upset must be determined for each of these 16 state vectors. b. Topological analysis approach. If a photomicrograph of the circuit is available, the number of required states can be reduced by examining the topology of the internal circuits. This allows one to eliminate the need to test paths with the same output state which have identical internal geometries. For the counter, this reduces the required number of states to two. This approach is recommended for more complex circuits where the multiple output logic approach results in too many required state vectors. 3.2 Transient output upset criteria. The transients that are permitted at logic outputs depend on the way that the system application allocates the noise margin of digital devices. Most systems use worst-case design criteria which are not directly applicable to sample testing because the samples represent typical, not worst-case parts, and have higher noise margins. For example, although the logic swing of TTL logic devices is typically greater than 2 volts, the worst-case noise margin is specified at 400 mV. In a typical system, much of this noise margin will be required for aberrations and electrical noise, leaving only part of it, 100 mV to 200 mV, for radiation-induced transients. Thus, the allowable voltage transient is far lower than the typical logic signal range. Loading conditions also have a large effect on output transients. However, transient upset testing is usually done at a fixed temperature under conditions that are more typical than they are worst-case. Thus, the noise margin during testing is much greater. The recommended default condition if not specified by the system is a transient voltage exceeding 1 V for CMOS or TTL logic devices with 5 V (nominal) power supply voltage, and 30 percent of the room-temperature logic level swing for other technologies such as ECL, open collector devices, or applications with other power supply voltages. Default loading conditions are minimum supply voltage and maximum fanout (maximum loading). The time duration of transient upset signals is also important. If the duration of the transient voltage change is less than the minimum value required for other circuits to respond to it, the transient signal shall not be considered an upset. The minimum time duration shall be one-half the minimum propagation delay time of basic gate circuits from the circuit technology that is being tested. Testing criteria may also be established for other parameters, such as the power supply current surge. Output current is also important for tri-state or uncommitted (\"open-collector\") circuits. These criteria must be specified by the test plan, and are normally based on particular system requirements.",
      "summary": "The following details shall be specified. a. Device type and quantity to be tested. b. Test circuit to be used, including output loading impedance. c. State vectors to be used in testing and device output pins to be monitored. d. Functional test sequence. e. Power supply voltage and bias conditions for all pins. f.

They must be capable of establishing the required test conditions and measuring the required electrical parameters. All instruments shall be periodically calibrated in accordance with the general requirements of this test method standard.",
      "procedure": "S. Two methods of testing are allowed by this procedure. The first is a long term test (sometimes referred to as a system test) which does not incorporate a source but which accumulates a statistically valid amount of test time to determine the SER directly. This method is self explanatory and must be accomplished using the same parameters outlined in 3.1 (test plan). To determine the SER from this method, the following formula should be used and the result converted to FIT's. SER = Total number of errors/Total test time The second method incorporates the use of the source outlined in 2.1 (radiation source). The procedure for testing with an accelerated flux provided by the source is given below. These steps will be followed for each test outlined in 3.1. a. The flux that the surface of the die would receive without a die coat will be determined. This is designated as the package flux. b. If the device has a die-coat it should be left in place for the next portion of the test. The DUT will be delidded and the source placed directly over the die cavity at the same distance as the package lid was from the die. NOTE: The distance between the foil and the die must be less than 50 mils and the foil must cover the entire die-cavity opening in order to assure all angles of incidence will be maintained. NOTE: If the DUT has an inverted die configuration (e.g., flip-chip) a test jig must be implemented which will expose the active surface of the die to the irradiating source. c. The testing outlined in 3.1 will be performed at this time with the configuration in b. above, in order to determine the SER for each test performed. d. Recorded for each test performed will be the following: (1) Total number of errors recorded during each test. (2) Time to accumulate the errors. (3) SER1, calculated from the following formulas: ASER1 = Total number of errors/test time SER1 = ASER1 x (Package flux/source flux) e. If no die-coating has been applied, the SER1 will be reported as the measured rate of failure. However, if a die coat exists, steps 3.f through 3.j will also be performed.",

      "purpose": "The purpose of this examination is to nondestructively detect defects within the sealed case, especially those resulting from the sealing process, and internal defects such as foreign objects, improper interconnecting wires, and voids in the die attach material or in the glass when glass seals are used. It establishes methods, criteria, and standards for radiographic examination of semiconductor and hybrid devices. NOTE: For certain device types, opacity of the construction materials (packages or internal attachment) may effectively prevent radiographic identification of certain types of defects from some or all possible viewing angles. This factor should be considered in relation to the design of each device when application of this test method is specified. 1.1 Definitions. A more complete listing of definitions related to radiography can be found in ASTM E 1316. 1.1.1 Device Under Test (DUT). The microelectronic device (monolithic or hybrid) that is the subject of the radiographic examination. 1.1.2 Digital radiography. For purposes of this test method, digital radiography is defined as a radiographic examination using x-ray as the source whereby the image is translated into digital data that is passed through an information processing algorithm to be transferred to a viewing media such as a display or monitor. It differs from film radiography, which is a direct transfer of the image onto film. 1.1.3 DUT lot. Multiple devices, all of the same type, that have been manufactured in a single production run and sequentially being tested as a group. 1.1.4 Dynamic Radiography. The acquisition of images in a continuous, full volumetric fashion where the DUT is placed in motion by a manipulation system to view multiple areas, axes and depths. (This is also referred to as real- time radiography.) Dynamic radiography generally results in a higher radiation dose to the DUT than static radiography due to longer exposure times. 1.1.5 Image Quality Indicator (IQI). A device manufactured with known conditions to be used to judge image quality. IQI’s shall conform to ASTM E 801. An IQI is a standard used for the purpose of qualifying/calibrating the apparatus. An IQI has built-in physical properties that can be used to adjust system parameters for best imaging results. 1.1.6 Qualified Test Personnel. An individual trained on the apparatus being used for radiography, and who is qualified to image or inspect. Personnel involved in acquisition or interpretation of radiographic images shall have training in radiographic imaging procedures and techniques so that defects revealed by this method can be validly interpreted and compared with applicable standards. Training shall be specific to the radiographic system (film or digital) as well as DUT design and failure criteria. The company employing the test personnel shall have a documented training program and will qualify test personnel internally. 1.1.7 Radiation Parameters. The radiation source related variables that can affect the examination outcome for the selected system configuration. Examples are source energy, collimation and intensity, focal spot size, filter in the X-ray beam, range of source to object distance, range of object to detector distance, and source to detector distance. 1.1.8 Real Time Radiography. See 1.1.4, Dynamic Radiography. 1.1.9 Representative Quality Indicator (RQI). Similar to an IQI, an RQI is a device manufactured with known conditions to be used as a representative object for the DUT. RQI’s shall conform to ASTM E 1817. An RQI is a device manufactured for the purpose of qualifying/calibrating the apparatus. An RQI has built-in physical properties that can be used to adjust system parameters for best imaging results.",

If the best attempt to obtain a clear image results in the inability of the radiographer to clearly see some or all of the reject-able criteria, this shall be noted as an exception on the inspection report and certificate of compliance. 3.1 Mounting and views. The devices shall be mounted in the holding fixture so that the devices are not damaged or contaminated and are in the proper plane as specified. The devices may be mounted in any type of fixture and masking may be employed to isolate multiple specimens provided the fixtures or masking material do not block the view from X-ray source to the film or detector of any portion of the body of the device. 3.1.1 Views. When the required view(s) show internal feature(s) that require a different viewing axis for verification and disposition of a failure mode specified in this test method, then additional views (either Z or X direction) shall be taken as record of the disposition. 3.1.1.1 Flat packages, dual-in-line packages, hybrid packages, and single ended cylindrical devices. Flat packages, dual-in-line packages, hybrid packages, and single ended cylindrical devices, unless otherwise specified, shall have one view taken with the X-rays penetrating in the Y direction as defined on figures 1 and 2 of MIL-STD- 883, GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.

These images collected prior to the DUT Lot imaging shall be saved for comparison with images of the same IQIs or RQIs taken following the DUT Lot imaging. Grayscale values of the IQI/RQI images collected post-DUT Lot imaging shall be within ±15% of the grayscale values of the reference image collected prior to DUT Lot imaging and all features of interest in the IQI or RQI shall be visible in the images collected before and after DUT Lot imaging. If the IQI/RQI images collected before and after DUT Lot imaging do not meet these requirements, it shall be presumed that the radiographic examination system conditions have been altered from the pre-DUT Lot imaging set up and the DUT Lot imaging shall be performed again after proper adjustments are made. 3.2.2.1 DPA/FA IQI/RQI Samples. Post inspection images of IQI or RQI is not required, however, when the imaging equipment is shut down for any reason (e.g., end of shift), additional IQI or RQI images shall be captured prior to continuing inspections.",

For packages with more than one glass-frit-seal (e.g., separate glass-frit-seals for the lid and the lead frame), each seal shall be torqued and rated separately against the failure criteria. A failure of either seal shall constitute failure of the test. Alternatively, the two seals may be simultaneously stressed by holding only the lid and base and applying the torque specified for the larger seal area. 3.2 Failure criteria. Failure criteria are based on not achieving the designated torque without breakage or lid separation. The designated torque is a function of the device seal area, as illustrated in Figure 2024-1. A device where package separation or breakage occurs at a torque value less than specified in table I shall constitute a failure. If the entire package (lid, seal, and base) breaks in a direction normal to the plane of the applied torque (i.e., showing evidence of improperly applied torque) with parts of lid and base still fused together, the package may be discarded without counting as a failure and a replacement sample substituted to complete the required testing.",

A filter bandwidth will be a maximum of one-third-octave or a frequency of 25 Hz, whichever is greater. 1/ Power-spectral density is the mean-square value of an oscillation passed by a narrow-band filter per unit-filter bandwidth. For this application it is expressed as G2/f where G2/f is the mean-square value of acceleration expressed in gravitational units per number of cycles of filter bandwidth. The spectral-density curves are usually plotted either on a logarithmic scale, or in units of decibels (dB).

      "purpose": "The purpose of this examination is to nondestructively detect unbonded regions, delaminations and/or voids in the die attach material and at interfaces within devices through the measurement of acoustic continuity. It establishes methods and criteria for ultrasonic inspection of devices. For certain device structures or die attach materials, a dramatic distinction between well-bonded and poorly bonded conditions may be difficult to achieve. This factor should be considered in relation to the design of each device when application of this test method is specified. 2. DEFINITIONS. 2.1 The term \"die attach interface\" as used in this test method refers to the entire bulk area between the die and the substrate to which it is bonded. For die attach interfaces, this includes the interface between the die attach material and the die, the interface between the die attach material and the substrate, plus the die attach material itself. 2.2 The term “bulk material” as used in this test method refers to the entire thickness within a specific layer of material. For die attach, the attachment material by itself is considered a bulk material. 2.3 The term “ultrasonic inspection” as used in this test method refers to high frequency ultrasonic visualization (imaging) which produces a gray or color scale output such as may be provided by ultrasonic scanning (US) or acoustic microscope (AM) techniques. The most common mode utilized for die attach inspection is an X-Y plane scan at specified depth(s) in Z, which is commonly referred to as C-Scan or C-mode imaging. Other ultrasonic techniques may also be utilized to obtain the die attach integrity data. 2.4 The term “reflected” as used in this test method refers to the change in direction of an ultrasound wave front at an interface between two different media so that the wave front returns via the medium from which it originated. 2.5 The term “reflection mode” as used in this test method refers to an ultrasonic scan or acoustic microscope that uses one transducer as both the pulser and receiver. (This is also known as a pulse/echo system.) 2.6 The term “transmitted” as used in this test method refers to the propagation of an ultrasound wave through a media or an interface between media that allows it to continue through the structure. 2.7 The term “transmission mode” as used in this test method refers to an ultrasonic scan or an acoustic microscope that transmits ultrasound completely through the sample from a sending transducer to a receiver on the opposite side. 3. APPARATUS. The apparatus and materials for this test shall include: 3.1 Ultrasonic inspection equipment: The ultrasonic inspection equipment shall have a test frequency sufficient to penetrate to the die attach material interface. In the case that the opening of a sealed hermetic or non-hermetic device with a known air cavity is undesirable, the ultrasonic equipment shall be capable of detecting an acoustic signal that enters the top and bottom or back of a package and is reflected by or transmitted through to the desired material interface. The test frequencies and focal distances shall be adequate to achieve a resolution capable of detecting voids as small as 0.0254 mm (0.001 inch) in diameter, when inspecting through the die is desired, but this may not be feasible due to the construction of the device. In such cases, the test frequency and focal distance shall be chosen to ensure penetration down to the desired material interface with the achievable resolution being a secondary consideration."

      "purpose": "The purpose of this method is to detect unbonded and insufficiently bonded sites in TAB (Tape automated bonding) devices in the open package condition, through the measurement of bond area by means of Scanning Laser Acoustic Microscope (SLAM) techniques. It establishes methods and criteria for ultrasonic inspection of these TAB semiconductor devices. NOTES: 1. For various metallurgical constitutions, absolute strengths expressed as pull strengths per unit area of bond differ. A scalar equivalency must be established for each alloy and process, to relate bond area to anticipated bond strength. 2. The term TAB bond in this document refers to one of the multiplicity of bonds, inner lead (ILB) or outer lead (OLB) formed by a tape automated bonding (TAB) process. In the case of ILB, it refers to that area of the device defined by the intersection of the beam lead, the semiconductor bonding pad area, and the contact outline of the thermode or fixture performing the bond, in the horizontal plane, and refers to all interfaces within that area between the semiconductor die surface and the beam lead. In the case of OLB, it refers to that area of the device defined by the intersection of the beam lead, the substrate bonding pad area, and contact outline of thermode or fixture performing the bond, in the horizontal plane, and refers to all interfaces within that area between the substrate surface and the beam lead. 3.

Ultrasonic imaging equipment of the scanning laser acoustic microscope type, of frequency and resolution sufficient to penetrate the bond area and render an image which discloses the size and shape of the bond area with a linear dimensional allowance no greater than 20 percent of a bond dimension. Frequency is dictated by consideration of the wavelength of sound in the materials and the limit of resolution. Whereas lower frequencies have been used for inspection of larger scale device types, the present size of TAB sites requires frequencies of from one hundred to several hundred megahertz. b. A visual output/storage device. A method of producing, displaying, and storing a scale image of adequate grey-scale range (minimum of 64 levels) shall be used. Such device may include a grey-scale printer/plotter, or preferably CRT display with an image digitizer capable of rendering images in digital code for bulk media storage and retrieval, and algorithmic processing and evaluation.

      "description": "This test method is performed to determine whether termination leads and other component parts can withstand the effects of the heat to which they will be subjected during the soldering process (solder iron, solder dip, solder wave, or solder reflow). The heat can be either conducted heat through the termination into the component part, or radiant heat from the solder bath when in close proximity to the body of the component part, or both. The solder dip method is used as a reasonably close simulation of the conditions encountered in wave soldering, in regard to radiated and conducted heat. This test also is intended to evaluate the impact of reflow techniques to which components may be exposed. The heat of soldering can cause solder reflow which may affect the electrical characteristics of the component part and may cause mechanical damage to the materials making up the part, such as loosening of terminations or windings, softening of insulation, opening of solder seals, and weakening of mechanical joints.",

      "purpose": "This method establishes the means of measuring the dc (steady- state) and ac (transient) noise margin of digital microelectronic devices or to determine compliance with specified noise margin requirements in the applicable acquisition document. It is also intended to provide assurance of interchangeability of devices and to eliminate misunderstanding between manufacturers and users on noise margin test procedures and results. The standardization of particular combinations of test parameters (e.g., pulse width, pulse amplitude, etc.) does not preclude the characterization of devices under test with other variations in these parameters. However, such variations shall, where applicable, be provided as additional conditions of test and shall not serve as a substitute for the requirements established herein. 1.1 Definitions. The following definitions shall apply for the purposes of this test method: a. Noise margin. Noise margin is defined as the voltage amplitude of extraneous signal which can be algebraically added to the noise-free worst case \"input\" level before the output voltage deviates from the allowable logic voltage levels. The term \"input\" (in quotation marks) is used here to refer to logic input terminals or ground reference terminals. b. DC noise margin. DC noise margin is defined as the dc voltage amplitude which can be algebraically added to the noise-free worst case \"input\" level before the output exceeds the allowable logic voltage levels. c. AC noise margin. AC noise margin is defined as the transient or pulse voltage amplitude which can be algebraically added to the noise-free worst case \"input\" level before the output voltage exceeds the allowable logic voltage levels. d. Maximum and minimum. Maximum and minimum refer to an algebraic system where \"max\" represents the most positive value of the range and \"min\" represents the least positive value of the range. 1.2 Symbols. The following symbols shall apply for the purposes of this test method and shall be used in accordance with the definitions provided (see 1.2.1, 1.2.2, and 1.2.3) and depicted on figures 3013-1, 3013-2, and 3013-3. 1.2.1 Logic levels. VIL max: The maximum allowed input LOW level in a logic system. VIL min: The minimum allowed input LOW level in a logic system. VIH max: The maximum allowed input HIGH level in a logic system. VIH min: The minimum allowed input HIGH level in a logic system. VOL max: The maximum output LOW level specified for a digital microelectronic device. VOL max is also the noise-free worst case input LOW level, VOL (max) < VIL (max) VOH min: The minimum output HIGH level specified for a digital microelectronic device. VOH min is also the noise-free worst case input HIGH level, VOH (min) > VIH (min) 1.2.2 Noise margin levels. VNL: The LOW level noise margin or input voltage amplitude which can be algebraically added to VOL (max) before the output level exceeds the allowed logic level. VNH: The HIGH level noise margin or input voltage amplitude which can be algebraically added to VOH (min) before the output level exceeds the allowed logic level.",
      "apparatus": "The apparatus used for noise margin measurements shall include a suitable source generator (see 2.1), load (see 2.2), and voltage detection devices for determining logic state. 2.1 Source generator. The source generator for this test shall be capable of supplying the required ac and dc noise inputs. In the case of pulsed inputs the transition times of the injected noise pulse shall each be maintained to less than 20 percent of the pulse width measured at the 50 percent amplitude level. For the purpose of this criteria, the transition times shall be between the 10 percent and 90 percent amplitude levels. The pulse repetition rate shall be sufficiently low that the element under test is at steady-state conditions prior to application of the noise pulse. For the purpose of this criteria, doubling the repetition rate or duty cycle shall not affect the outcome of the measurement. 2.2 Load. The load for this test shall simulate the circuit parameters of the normal load which would be applied in application of the device under worst-case conditions. The load shall automatically change its electrical parameters as the device under test changes logic state if this is the normal situation for the particular device load. The load shall be paralleled by a high impedance voltage detection device.",

As defined in 1.1, noise margin is the amplitude of extraneous signal which may be added to a noise-free worst case \"input\" level before the output breaks the allowable logic levels. This definition of noise margin allows the measurement of both dc and ac noise immunity on logic inputs or power supply lines or ground reference lines by detection of either a maximum LOW level or a minimum HIGH level at the output terminal. Since the output level never exceeds the allowable logic level under conditions of injected noise, the noise is not considered to propagate through the element under test. 3.1.2 Superposition of simultaneously injected noise. Because the logic levels are restored after one stage, and because the noise margin measurement is performed with all \"inactive\" inputs at the worst case logic levels, the proper system logic levels are guaranteed in the presence of simultaneous disturbances separated by at least one stage.",

It is important to ground the package using the same pins as would be used in the microcircuit application. If the package has an internal ground plane or ground section, this should be connected via package pin(s) to the exterior test set-up ground plane. The package should be connected to the test set-up with coaxial cable or stripline. Unshielded conductor medium should not be used between the signal source and package. Coaxial shields must be grounded at both ends of the cable. Package sockets should not be used unless these are to be part of the microcircuit application configuration. Package leads must be formed and trimmed as specified in the application. Package-to-chip interconnecting media shall be installed in the package and used to connect to the load resistors. 3.1.2 Pin selection. For simple packages with symmetrical, parallel pin conductors, only a sample of pin combinations need be tested.

Connect the test equipment as shown on figure 3018-1. Use a 50 Ω chip resistor load in the driven pin channel, unless otherwise specified. For the pick-up channel, use the load resistor value(s) as specified by the acquisition document. (Load resistor values should be set such that the parallel combination of load resistance and probe impedance matches as closely as practical the specified load impedance of a single receiver in the logic system to be used in the microcircuit application.) Check the residual cross-coupling of the measuring set-up by touching the probe to the pick-up channel load before the pick-up pin is connected to the resistor. Measure and record the peak pulse voltage observed. This peak pulse reading must be less than 50 percent of the reading observed with the pin connected to the resistor for a reading to be valid. Adjust the test set-up cable orientation and configuration to minimize this residual cross-coupling.",

If a closed loop gain versus frequency plot is made, peaking is the amount by which the gain may increase over its nominal value just before it falls off. 3 dB of peaking will result from a phase margin of 45°. Thus, it is desirable to keep the peaking less than 3 dB. 1.1.3 Slew rate.

It must be used in conjunction with other documentation such as appendix A of MIL-PRF-38535 or an applicable device specification to establish the design, material, performance, control, and documentation requirements which are needed to achieve prescribed levels of device quality and reliability. In recognition of the fact that the level of screening has a direct impact on the cost of the product as well as its quality and reliability, two standard levels of screening are provided to coincide with two device classes or levels of product assurance. Since it is not possible to prescribe an absolute level of quality or reliability which would result from a particular screening level or to make a precise value judgment on the cost of a failure in an anticipated application, two levels have been arbitrarily chosen. The method provides flexibility in the choice of conditions and stress levels to allow the screens to be further tailored to a particular source, product, or application based on user experience. The user is cautioned to collect experience data so that a legitimate value judgment can be made with regard to specification of screening levels. Selection of a level better than that required for the specific product and application will, of course, result in unnecessary expense and a level less than that required will result in an unwarranted risk that reliability and other requirements will not be met. In the absence of specific experience data, the class B screening level is recommended for general applications. Guidance in selecting screening levels or predicting the anticipated reliability for microcircuits may be obtained from MIL-HDBK-217 Military Standardization Handbook Reliability Prediction.

Method 5004.13 20 June 2014 w/ CHANGE 1 APPENDIX A PURPOSE: This appendix addresses two problems. First, Test Method 2010 visual criteria for wafer fab induced defects is unsuitable for complex wafer process technologies, as in most cases the defects themselves cannot be seen through 200X magnification. Secondly, no current alternate suitably addresses defect control of complex wafer fab technologies. Section 20 of this document describes the conditions under which this procedure is invoked. This document implements a new technique for controlling and eliminating wafer fab induced defects, while preserving and extending the intent of the original Test Method 2010 visual criteria. The essence of this procedure revolves around the concept that it is a manufacturer's responsibility to define and document its approach to defect reduction and control in a manner that is acceptable to the manufacturer and their qualifying activity, as specified in section 30 of this document. This includes an understanding of the reliability impact of wafer fab process-induced defects. It is expected that considerable dialogue will occur between a manufacturer and the qualifying activity, resulting in mutually agreeable defect control procedures. This document is deliberately non-specific regarding metrics such as defect sizes, defect densities, correlation and risks to allow adaptability for different process technologies, different manufacturing control methods and continuous improvement. The procedures are specified in this document with the intent that metrics and their values will be made more specific via dialogue between a manufacturer and its qualifying activity. Defect characterization is addressed in section 40 of this document. A key element in this section is understanding the effects of process defects on final product reliability. This understanding can be achieved in many ways, including: experimentation, review of pertinent literature and certain semiconductor traditions. The depth and scope of any characterization will be determined by a manufacturer and its qualifying activity. The concept of demonstration is discussed in many sections of this document. The methods for demonstrating defect understanding have been made as diverse as possible to allow flexibility. As described in section 90 of this document, results of defect characterization must be documented as well as the methods for monitoring and controlling defect levels. The effectiveness of any screens that are used (in-line or end- of-line) must also be documented. The ultimate requirements for demonstration and documentation will be determined between a manufacturer and its qualifying activity. The qualifying activity will be concerned with maintenance of institutional knowledge and the level to which a manufacturer understands: defect generation, control, reduction, prevention and the effects of defects on product reliability. This document makes the underlying assumption that a manufacturer will undertake efforts to continuously improve defect levels (i.e. reduce these levels) in its wafer fabrication processes. As part of this assumption, it is expected that the inspections, as outlined in section 50 of this document, will be used to acquire information for defect level reduction. The intent is not to create inspections which \"inspect in\" quality, though screens of this nature may be a part of a manufacturer's integrated defect control system. Rather, it is intended to provide an effective means of defect prevention, control and reducing defects generated by the wafer process. Ideally, the manufacturer is striving to continually improve its control systems. Sections 60, 70 and 80 of this document deal with excursion containment, yield analysis and a system for unexpected failure. This document makes extensive use of examples and attachments to illustrate key points and ways in which these points could be implemented. The examples are intended to be no more than examples, illustrating how the items in this procedure might be performed in a given instance. They are not intended to specify the way items must be done. A glossary of terms is provided in section 100 of this document."

The full requirements of groups A, B, C, D, and E tests and inspections are intended for use in initial device qualification, requalification in the event of product or process change, and periodic testing for retention of qualification. Groups A and B tests and inspections are required for quality conformance inspection on individual inspection lots as a condition for acceptance for delivery. Groups C and D tests are required for quality conformance inspection on a periodic basis as a condition for acceptance for delivery. Group E tests are qualification and quality conformance procedures to be utilized only for radiation hardness assurance levels as specified in Table V. In general, it is intended that the device class level to which qualification or quality conformance inspection is conducted would be the same device class level to which screening procedures (in accordance with method 5004) are conducted. However, it is permissible for qualification or quality conformance procedures to be specified at a higher quality level (in no case shall a lower level be permitted) to reduce the potential percent-defective. It is also permissible to specify tightened inspection criteria for individual subgroups where experience indicates justifiable concern for specific quality problems.

      "purpose": "This test procedure specifies the methods by which fault coverage is reported for a test program applied to a microcircuit herein referred to as the device under test (DUT). This procedure describes requirements governing the development of the logic model of the DUT, the assumed fault model and fault universe, fault classing, fault simulation, and fault coverage reporting. This procedure provides a consistent means of reporting fault coverage regardless of the specific logic and fault simulator used. Three procedures for fault simulation are described in this procedure: Full fault simulation and two fault sampling procedures. The applicable acquisition document shall specify a minimum required level of fault coverage and, optionally, specify the procedure to be used to determine the fault coverage. A fault simulation report shall be provided that states the fault coverage obtained, as well as documenting assumptions, approximations, and procedures used. Where any technique detailed in this procedure is inapplicable to some aspect of the logic model, or inconsistent with the functionality of the available fault simulator and simulation postprocessing tools, it is sufficient that the user of this procedure employ an equivalent or comparable technique and note the discrepancy in the fault simulation report. Microcircuits may be tested by nontraditional methods of control or observation, such as power supply current monitoring or the addition of test points that are available by means of special test modes. Fault coverage based on such techniques shall be considered valid if substantiating analysis or references are provided in the fault simulation report. 1.1 Terms. Terms and abbreviations not defined elsewhere in the text of this test procedure are defined in this section. a. Automatic test equipment (ATE). The apparatus with which the actual DUT will be tested. ATE includes the ability to apply a test vector sequence (see 1.1l). b. Broadside application. A method of applying a test vector sequence where input stimuli change only at the beginning of a simulation cycle or ATE cycle and all changes on primary inputs of the DUT are assumed to be simultaneous. Nonbroadside application occurs when test vectors are conditioned by additional timing information such as delay (with respect to other primary inputs), return-to-zero, return-to-one, and surround-by- complement. c. Detection. An error at an observable primary output of a logic model caused by the existence of a logic fault. A hard detection is where an observable output value in the fault-free logic model is distinctly different from the corresponding output value in the faulty logic model. An example of a hard detection is where the fault-free logic model's output value is 0 and the faulty logic model's output value is 1, or where the fault-free logic model's output value is 1 and the faulty logic model's output value is 0. If the high-impedance state (Z) can be sensed by the ATE, then a hard detection can involve the Z state as well. A potential detection is an error where the fault-free output is 0 or 1 and the faulty output value is unknown (X), or Z if Z cannot be sensed by the ATE. d. Established test algorithm. An algorithm, procedure, or test vector sequence, that when applied to a logic component or logic partition has a known fault coverage or test effectiveness. This fault coverage or test effectiveness is denoted herein as the established fault coverage or established test effectiveness for the established test algorithm. For example, an established test algorithm for a RAM may be a published memory test algorithm, such as GALPAT, that has been shown by experience to detect essentially all RAM failures and therefore is assessed an established test effectiveness of 100 percent. An ALU may be tested by means of a precomputed test vector sequence for which fault coverage has been previously determined. More than one established test algorithm may exist for a logic component or logic partition, each with a different established fault coverage or test effectiveness.",
      "apparatus": "2.1 Logic simulator. Implementation of this test procedure requires the use of a facility capable of simulating the behavior of fault-free digital logic in response to a test vector sequence; this capability is herein referred to as logic simulation. In order to simulate sequential digital logic, the simulator must support simulation of a minimum of four logic states: zero (0), one (1), high-impedance (Z), and unknown (X). In order to simulate combinational digital logic only, the simulator must support simulation of a minimum of two logic states: 0 and 1. At the start of logic simulation of a logic model of a DUT containing sequential logic, the state of every logic line and component containing memory shall be X; any other initial condition, including explicit initialization of any line or memory element to 0 or 1, shall be documented and justified in the fault simulation report. In order to simulate wired connections or bus structures, the simulator must be capable of resolving signal conflicts introduced by such structures. Otherwise, modeling workarounds shall be permitted to eliminate such structures from the logic model (see 3.1.2). In order to simulate sequential digital logic, the simulator must support event- directed simulation. As a minimum, unit-delay logic components must be supported. Simulation of combinational-only logic, or simulation of sequential logic in special cases (such as combinational logic extracted from a scannable sequential logic model) can be based on nonevent-directed simulation, such as levelized, zero-delay, or compiled-code methods. The fault simulation report shall describe why the selected method is equivalent to the more general event-directed method. 2.2 Fault simulator. In addition to the capability to simulate the fault-free digital logic, the capability is also required to simulate the effect of single, permanent, stuck-at-zero and stuck-at-one faults on the behavior of the logic; this capability is herein referred to as fault simulation. Fault simulation shall reflect the limitations of the target ATE (see 3.4.1). It is not necessary that the fault simulator directly support the requirements of this test procedure in the areas of hard versus potential detections, fault universe selection, and fault classing. However, the capability must exist, at least indirectly, to report fault coverage in accordance with this procedure. Where approximations arise (for example, where fault classing compensates for a different method of fault universe selection) such differences shall be documented in the fault simulation report, and it shall be shown that the approximations do not increase the fault coverage obtained.",
      "procedure": "3.1 Logic model. 3.1.1 Level of modeling. The DUT shall be described in terms of a logic model composed of components and connections between components. Primary inputs to the logic model are assumed to be outputs of an imaginary component (representing the ATE's drivers), and primary outputs of the logic model are assumed to be inputs to an imaginary component (representing the ATE's comparators). Some logic simulators require that the ATE drivers and comparators be modeled explicitly; however, these components shall not be considered to be part of the logic model of the DUT. 3.1.2 Logic lines and nodes (see 1.1g). All fan-out from a node in a logic model is ideal, that is, fan-out branches associated with a node emanate from a single point driven by a fan-out origin. All fan-in to a node in a logic model is ideal; that is, multiple fan-in branches in a node drive a single line. Figure 1 shows a node that includes fan-in branches, a fan-out origin, and fan-out branches. Because fan-in and fan-out generally are not ideal in actual circuit layout, the actual topology of the circuit should be modeled, if it is known, by appropriately adding single-input noninverting buffers to the logic model. Modeling workarounds may be used to eliminate fan-in to a node. This may be required if the simulator does not directly model wired connections or bus structures. Some simulators may permit internal fan-in, but require that bidirectional pins to a DUT be modeled as separate input and output functions. 3.1.3 G-logic and B-logic partitions. Simple components of the logic model (logic primitives such as AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, buffers, or flip-flops; generally the indivisible primitives understood by a simulator) are herein referred to as gate logic (G-logic). Complex components of the logic model (such as RAM, ROM, or PLA primitive components, and behavioral models - relatively complex functions that are treated as \"black boxes\" for the purpose of fault simulation) are referred to herein as block logic (B-logic). For the purpose of fault simulation, the logic model shall be divided into nonoverlapping logic partitions; however, the entire logic model may consist of a single logic partition. The logic partitions contain components and their associated lines; although lines may span partitions, no component is contained in more than one partition. A G-logic partition contains only G-logic; any other logic partition is a B-logic partition. A logic partition consisting of G-logic, or B-logic, or G-logic and B-logic that, as a unit, is testable using an established testing algorithm, with known fault coverage or test effectiveness, may be treated as a single B-logic partition. 3.1.4 Model hierarchy. The logic model may be hierarchical (that is, consisting of macro building blocks), or flat (that is, a single level of hierarchy with no macro building blocks). Hierarchy does not impose structures on lines; for example, there is no implied fan-out origin at a macro input or output. Macros that correspond to physical partitions in a model shall use additional buffers (or an equivalent method) to enforce adherence to the actual DUT's fan-out. 3.1.5 Fractions of transistors. The fraction of transistors comprising each G-logic and B-logic partition, with respect to the total count of transistors in the DUT, shall be determined or closely estimated; the total sum of the transistor fractions shall equal 1. Where the actual transistor counts are not available, estimates may be made on the basis of gate counts or microcircuit area; the assumptions and calculations supporting such estimates shall be documented in the fault simulation report. The transistor fractions shall be used in order to weight the fault coverage measured for each individual logic partition (see 3.5).",

For each B-logic partition tested in this way the established test algorithm, proof of its successful application, and description of its established fault coverage or test effectiveness (including classes of faults detected) shall be documented. (4) Justification for any initial condition, other than X, for any logic line or memory element. (5) Justification for any approximations used, including estimates of fault coverages, transistor fractions, and counts of undetectable faults. (6) Description of any fault equivalencing procedure used in lieu of the procedure defined by table II. (7) Justification for declaring any fault to be undetectable. (8) In the event that the test vector sequence is formatted differently between the ATE and the fault simulator, justification that fault coverage achieved on the ATE is not lower than the reported fault coverage. (9) Justification of the use of fault simulation procedure 2 or 3 rather than fault simulation procedure 1. (10) When fault sampling is used, description of the method of obtaining a random sample of faults. (11) In the event that the fault simulation procedure used is not obviously equivalent to fault simulation procedure 1, 2, or 3, justification as to why it yields equivalent results. (12) In the event that a test technique or design-for-testability approach is used that provides additional control or observation test points beyond those provided by the DUT's primary inputs and primary outputs (see 1.1j), justification that the stated fault coverage is valid."

      "procedure": "The procedures defined herein specify the wafer fabrication controls and wafer acceptance tests necessary for the production of GaAs wafers compliant to the requirements of this test method. 3.1 Precedence. Unless otherwise specified in the device specification or drawing, the test requirements and conditions shall be as given herein. 3.2 Wafer fabrication line controls. 3.2.1 Process baseline. The use of this test method is restricted to a well characterized (controlled) and baselined process. By \"characterized\" it is meant that the fabrication line has been adequately documented in relation to the capabilities of the process. \"Baselined\" refers to the existence of a well defined process parameter target value with associated variances (based on characterization data) against which the actual wafer to wafer process data is measured to determine acceptability. The manufacturer shall submit process baseline documentation as specified herein to the acquiring activity for approval. 3.2.2 Statistical process control. The manufacturers shall have implemented statistical process control (SPC) for the wafer fabrication line in accordance with the requirements of TechAmerica EIA-557. 3.2.2.1 Alternate visual inspection procedure for class level B microcircuits. A sample plan for visual inspection in accordance with 3.1 of test method 2010 may be implemented in lieu of 100 percent visual inspection for processes controlled by the SPC program. The sample size for inspection shall be identified in the baseline process documentation. 3.2.3 Incoming material evaluation. Incoming material evaluation shall be performed as documented in the process baseline to assure compatibility with wafer fabrication specifications and manufacturing procedures. 3.2.4 Electrostatic discharge sensitivity. The manufacturer shall develop and implement an ESD control program for the wafer fabrication area. 3.2.5 Failure analysis. When required by the applicable device specification or drawing, failure analysis shall be performed on wafers rejected at in-process or acceptance testing. 3.3 Wafer acceptance tests. 3.3.1 General. This wafer lot acceptance procedure is based on wafer visual inspection and electrical testing of suitable process monitors (PMs), see table I. The performance of each wafer shall be evaluated individually. Process monitor measurements, verifying that the identified baseline parameters are within process limits, will be required from each wafer lot in accordance with 3.3.2 herein."
